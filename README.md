## ðŸš€ Project Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A running [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) instance (local or a free cloud instance from [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)).

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Create an environment file:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the `backend` directory and add the following variables. **Replace the placeholder values.**

    ```
    # Your MongoDB Atlas connection string or local DB string
    MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@yourcluster.mongodb.net/dropify

    # A long, random, secret string for JWT
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key

    # Optional: Change the port the server runs on
    PORT=5000
    ```
    > **Security Note:** Ensure your MongoDB Atlas cluster has your current IP address whitelisted under "Network Access".

4.  **Seed the database with initial products:**
    This command will wipe the existing products and populate the database with the items defined in `backend/utils/seeder.js`.
    ```bash
    node utils/seeder.js
    ```

5.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The backend API will now be running, typically at `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend (root) directory:**
    Open a **new, separate terminal** and navigate to the root `vue-project` folder.

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the frontend server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The Vue application will now be running, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 3. Creating an Admin User

Admin access is granted manually for security.
1.  **Register a new user** on the website through the "Create Account" form.
2.  **Log out** immediately.
3.  **Connect to your MongoDB database** (e.g., via Atlas "Browse Collections").
4.  Navigate to the `users` collection.
5.  Find the user you just created and edit their document.
6.  Add a new field named `isAdmin`, set its type to `Boolean`, and set the value to `true`.
7.  Save the change. You can now log in with this user on the "Admin Login" tab to access the admin panel.
